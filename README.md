## Project Overview

This project visualizes key metrics and trends related to bank loans using Tableau. It aims to provide insights into loan funding, investments, and payments, along with detailed analysis of loan statuses, ownership types, and payment verification.

## Key Visualizations

1. **Total Fund, Investment, and Payment (KPIs)**:  
   - Displays the overall financial metrics, including:
     - **Total Fund**: $434.81M
     - **Total Investment**: $459.41M
     - **Total Payment**: $482.70M

2. **Home Ownership vs Last Payment Date (Treemap)**:  
   - Shows the distribution of home ownership (Rent or Mortgage) in relation to the last payment date.

3. **Grade & Sub-Grade Wise Revolving Balance (Bar Chart)**:  
   - Highlights the balance revolved across different loan grades and sub-grades.

4. **State-wise & Last Credit Pull Wise Loan Status (Table)**:  
   - Presents loan status details by year, breaking down the data by states (CA, FL, NJ, NY, TX) and the latest credit pull date.

5. **Year-Wise Loan Amount (Stacked Bar Chart)**:  
   - Shows how loan amounts have been distributed across different years, with categories such as 'Charged Off', 'Current', and 'Fully Paid'.

6. **Verified vs Non-Verified Status Payment (Donut Chart)**:  
   - Compares the total payment amounts for verified vs non-verified status loans.
     - **Total Payment**: $373M  
     - **Verified Payments**: $220M  
     - **Non-Verified Payments**: $154M

## Filters Available

- **Loan Status**: Filter by the loan's current status (e.g., Fully Paid, Charged Off).
- **Purpose**: Filter by the purpose of the loan.
- **Year of Issue**: Filter loans by the year they were issued.

## Technical Details

- **Platform**: Tableau Desktop Public Edition
- **Data Sources**: Bank loan dataset with historical data on funding, investment, loan statuses, ownership, verification, and more.
- **Visual Elements**: Treemaps, bar charts, stacked bar charts, donut charts, and tables for a comprehensive view of loan-related metrics.

## Key Features

- **Interactivity**: The dashboard allows users to filter data based on Loan Status, Purpose, and Year of Issue.
- **KPI Display**: Highlights key financial statistics such as Total Fund, Total Investment, and Total Payment.
- **Detailed Analysis**: Provides a breakdown of loan statuses by year and state, allowing for granular insights into regional trends.

## Future Work

- **Additional Filters**: Implement more filters for refined data analysis, such as borrower demographics.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Incorporate machine learning models for predicting future loan statuses based on historical data.
